Signals:

Clocks: trigger things on rise/fall edge, have a clock tree / clock domain, can't be directly driven by a listener but can eg depend on the state of some other signal
Busses: Sample / drive at a point, maybe have pull up / pull down set so driving it only affects it in the relevant way eg driving 0 when something else is driving 1 might not do anything
Interrupts: Kind of like a clock, has a trigger?
Network: Model propagation delay somehow?

Clocked vs combinatorial stuff?
