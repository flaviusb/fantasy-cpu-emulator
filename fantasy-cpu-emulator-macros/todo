Bundle (sort of) state into stage functions
tick function include

tick(advance_by, allstate) -> allstate
where allstate = 
  memories
  pipeline state
  statebundle
  cancels

and advance_by is in units of 1/product_{0}^{i}(device_base_speed_{i}) where cycles are multiplied by product_{1}^{i}(device_base_speed_{i}) (with device 0 as the core in question) ... or something

memory filler (with assembly)
superproject - basic potato
ring buffer -> sound
argument parsing
file attachment

memory image
addresses
labels
segments
literal bit insertion
constraints

The executable image format, the system image format, and the 'at rest' format are seperate but related
for example, for potato, there needs to be a streaming container format for the executable image, the system image format includes reified datastructures for eg the stack, and the 'at rest' format is 'how to pack this and where eg into memories, on disc etc'.
