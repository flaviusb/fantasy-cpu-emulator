Fantasy CPU Emulator
--------------------

This is an emulator for my fantasy cpu design.


## Installation

If you have a relatively recent Rust (1.47 or later) you should be able to install by cloning the repo and then running `cargo test` in the root of the repo.

## Is this any good?

No, I have got part of the Jackfruit chip working, but not any of the other chips or any of the emulation of other hardware.
